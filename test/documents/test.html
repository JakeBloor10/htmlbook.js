<h1>Welcome to Rails</h1>

<p>Rails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to
    create database-backed web applications according to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model-View-Controller (MVC)</a>
pattern.</p>
<p>Understanding the MVC pattern is key to understanding Rails. MVC divides
    your application into three layers, each with a specific responsibility.</p>
<p>The <em>Model layer</em> represents your domain model (such as Account,
    Product, Person, Post, etc.) and encapsulates the business logic that is
    specific to your application. In Rails, database-backed model classes are
    derived from
<code>ActiveRecord::Base</code>. Active Record allows you to
    present the data from database rows as objects and embellish these data
    objects with business logic methods. Although most Rails models are backed
    by a database, models can also be ordinary Ruby classes, or Ruby classes
    that implement a set of interfaces as provided by the Active Model module.
    You can read more about Active Record in its <a href="activerecord/README.rdoc">README</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Controller layer</em> is responsible for handling incoming HTTP
    requests and providing a suitable response. Usually this means returning
    HTML, but Rails controllers can also generate XML, JSON, PDFs, mobile-specific
    views, and more. Controllers load and manipulate models, and render view
    templates in order to generate the appropriate HTTP response. In Rails,
    incoming requests are routed by Action Dispatch to an appropriate controller,
    and controller classes are derived from <code>ActionController::Base</code>.
    Action Dispatch and Action Controller are bundled together in Action Pack.
    You can read more about Action Pack in its
<a href="actionpack/README.rdoc">README</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>View layer</em> is composed of &quot;templates&quot; that are responsible
    for providing appropriate representations of your application&#39;s resources.
    Templates can come in a variety of formats, but most view templates are
    HTML with embedded Ruby code (ERB files). Views are typically rendered
    to generate a controller response, or to generate the body of an email.
    In Rails, View generation is handled by Action View. You can read more
    about Action View in its <a href="actionview/README.rdoc">README</a>.</p>
<p>Active Record, Action Pack, and Action View can each be used independently
    outside Rails. In addition to them, Rails also comes with Action Mailer
    (<a href="actionmailer/README.rdoc">README</a>), a library to generate
    and send emails; and Active Support (<a href="activesupport/README.rdoc">README</a>),
    a collection of utility classes and standard library extensions that are
    useful for Rails, and may also be used independently outside Rails.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Install Rails at the command prompt if you haven&#39;t yet:</p>
<pre><code> gem install rails</code></pre>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>At the command prompt, create a new Rails application:</p>
<pre><code> rails new myapp</code></pre>

        <p>where &quot;myapp&quot; is the application name.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Change directory to <code>myapp</code> and start the web server:</p>
<pre><code> cd myapp
 rails server</code></pre>

        <p>Run with <code>--help</code> or <code>-h</code> for options.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Go to <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> and you&#39;ll
            see: &quot;Welcome aboard: You&#39;re riding Ruby on Rails!&quot;</p>
